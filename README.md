Simple bash script that strips last 10 lines of the /var/log/pacman.log file. Extracts matching string and converts timestamp into human readable format.

To run this script:
1. Make it executable: chmod +x /path/to/this/script
2. (optionally) Add this script to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file. This way every time you launch the terminal, it will show the last time full system upgrade been run.
